# online-food-ordering-system
This online food ordering application has been developed using Java and a MySQL database, utilizing the NetBeans IDE environment. 
Customers can browse food items and add them to the cart without logging in, but they need to be logged in to place an order. Logged-in users remain in a session until they log out.
